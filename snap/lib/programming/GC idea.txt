for non-recursive gc just do incref/decref whenever data is assigned (including to the stack, every reference, and it's the caller/op that does the refcounting (calling method)

for recursive (when we assign an object into it's own hierarchy), add the parent type as an identity (base class name?  or instance/reference...) with a count (each time added, increase the count), and then each object has a list of super objects, so we can scan the object hierarchy by scanning the ones listed, until we reach the top
	-- if dependency is detected then we use a weakref (just don't change the refcount up or down)... simple?
	-- XXX but a class can appear without the instance referencing the object...  so it might have to be per-instance (full list of each parent, and walk it to find ourself, and if found don't change refcount)

	-- we need list of parent instances, but if the same instance occurs then do a count (meaning that the parent is used in multiple assigns of the same object -- ie. a.b = x and a.c = x where a is now a parent of x twice)
		-- maybe we can indicate along with the assign the information of whether the assign was recursive?  then we only have to check once...
