# TODO similar to new dynamic event system, assets property leads to asset manager to easily keep track of a bunch of assets without having to define properties or just throw them into the children list...
#	-- could also handle ordering, layer swapping, and layout!  while making assets exchangable and identifiable by name
#	-- re-assigning asset should keep the original reference so we can recover the original by just passing 'asset'=True

	# TODO set(*names, **assigns) where names are render order, and assigns are assigning the graphics to the names...
