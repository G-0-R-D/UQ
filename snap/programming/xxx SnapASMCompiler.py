# TODO: WISHLIST: maybe someday it would be possible to just encode right into assembly?  then everything is likely possible, and optimal...  but at the moment I am not capable of such a thing!

# TODO: IDEA: one way to approach this would be to compile simple programs (like single elements) for every ast capability a language provides, then disassemble that code and see how it is done: then replicate it...?

# XXX although this could work I think c is the better choice for 2 reasons:
# 1. c has more complex logic making it easier to think about and implement the operators, we can implement the concepts of object orientation and stuff like that more easily than in assembly
# 2. assembly isn't very standardized, it varies between hardware, but c is the same and compiles into all the flavours of assembly you could need!
# NOTE: it sill might be useful to disassemble mini programs to understand how operations are implemented in assembly...
