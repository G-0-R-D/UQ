this is intended as just a FYI for now, since I'm not at the point of a 'user release', nor would I know how to make one at the moment...

ABOUT:

	Think of this project as 'technological glue', the goal is to be able to connect code elements together
	that were not originally designed to connect together.  Easily.  By unifying programming languages into one
	central form, and by presenting a generic communications interface/protocol (SnapNode protocol) that can
	be used to connect code elements together at runtime.  With this ability, code from different projects (and even
	different languages) can be made to connect together to create new behaviours and programs...

	UQ: "You Queue" meaning you queue up program elements and then run them.  This is a gui-based
		end-user program intended to be used to connect SnapNode components together in a drag-and-drop
		fashion.

		TODO:
			- largely not implemented yet, but it's mostly just going to be a mainwindow with the ability
				to add ENV elements to the scene by name and provides a graphical type that will be able
				to render any arbitrary code element as either a node or using it's draw method if available...

	snap: the library that implements the SnapNode protocol, and which provides the backend api
		to use os-specific interfaces with a general api (things like os, graphics, gui, networking, multiprocessing, ...)

DISCLAIMER:

	- I'm a self-taught programmer, learning as I go (for more than a decade now); I'm an art major
	- I'm brand new to git and github
	- this is being released even though it's "not ready" with the hope of getting more eyes on it
		and feedback or contributions to make it better.  The idea of compiling programming languages
		is a new addition, and I'm just starting to learn about it now.  The graphical/gui system is
		much more mature.
	- my coding philosphy is "less is more", and I always strive to create less code and simplify structures
		into smaller and shorter interfaces as much as possible.
		I value readability over speed (and this project is not aimed at programming professionals looking to
		get maximum performance, but casuals / novices / grandmas(?) looking for a way to easily get their
		computer to do what they want it to do...)

LICENSE:

INSTALL:
	* I'm on linux, not sure how to do this on other systems (but it shouldn't be too hard!)

	open a terminal in the directory where you want UQ to be and type:
		"git clone https://github.com/G-0-R-D/UQ"

	using your version of python (with pip already installed), run:
		"python -m pip install numpy PyQt5"

		* I'm not sure if the Qt5 version matters much, any version might work?  The plan is
			to phase out this dependency later on anyway...

	then install gcc and clang:
		"sudo apt-get install gcc clang"

	then make sure the "../UQ/snap" folder is visible to your python install so that "from snap.SnapEnv import SnapEnv"
		works from anywhere you call it.  I do this by just adding a symlink to the snap folder in my python main directory:
			"ln -s ../snap ../python<x>/snap"
				** ^^ but be sure to use absolute (full) paths!  relative paths don't work in symlinks...!

		* NOTE: UQ does not need to be on your path, it is meant to be run as a module directly ("python UQ.py"),
			it just makes use of snap, so that must be on your path.




ORIENTATION:

../snap/lib/core:

	SnapNode:

		- the base type (object) of all other types, which overrides __getitem__, __setitem__, __delitem__ to
			redirect to SnapProperties

		- use "<SnapNode>['prop']" to access a property, and "<SnapNode>.channel" to access a SnapChannel
			NOTE: you can access properties as attributes too since they are also channels...

		- __snap_data__ is a special implementation of a dict (missing keys just result in no-op, so "del self.__snap_data__['x']"
			quietly does nothing if there is no 'x', and "self.__snap_data__['x']" returns None if there is no 'x')

	@SnapChannel decorator:

		- represents an event, action, or other "behaviour" -- something that you do or something that happens...

		- can send (immediately sends to all listeners of this channel) or emit (queues up sending until the next mainloop
			iteration; asynchronous events)

		- implemented as a "def method(self, MSG)" where MSG is a SnapMessage() instance (part of how communication is standardized)
			with a docstring to describe acceptable arguments:
				NOTE: docstrings aren't actually used anywhere yet, and the syntax is not finalized...
				"" empty string means this is not intended to be used as a connectible interface (might only emit, no input)
				"()" means no args means anything can be connected to it (it doesn't use the message)
				"(type)" or "(type!)" or "(type?)" mean arg, required arg, or optional arg, with only a type descriptor
				"(type name)" or "(type name!)" or "(type name?)" is same but with a name attached as well
					(messages will try to connect names together, or possibly allow re-mapping names by type
					when a connection is negotiated -- TODO...)

		- a channel is identified by it's name, same name means same channel
			- (usually connective behaviour is done per-element, where two code objects are connected directly to eachother
				in a hard coupling.  Listeners actually just "subscribe" to the name of the channel, not the actual channel itself)
				-- ie. listeners are stored on the SnapNode.__snap_listeners__ under the channel name, not on the SnapChannel!

	@SnapProperty decorator:

		- represents a type, or atleast a data-based access point.  Data can be generated dynamically when requested.
		
		- implemented using a class and a "def set(self, MSG)", "def get(self, MSG)" and "def delete(self, MSG)"
			with a docstring in each:
				"()->type" if '->' comes after parenthesis then it is the return value (just a type)
				NOTE: if a get() accepts args then it is preferrable to use node.prop.get(args...)

		- is a subclass of channel so can also send/emit like a channel
			- call "self.changed(property=value)" when data changes and SnapNode will emit through that property for you

		** NOTE: self inside of the set/get/delete implementations is the instance that owns the property!  not the property itself...
			

	@myproperty.alias:

		- allows for mapping multiple names to the same channel or property implementation

	connecting:

		# runnable example:
		"""
		from snap.SnapEnv import SnapEnv

		ENV = SnapEnv()
		SnapNode = ENV.SnapNode

		class Example(SnapNode):

			@ENV.SnapChannel
			def channel(self, MSG):
				"(str hello!)"
				ENV.snap_out('hello', MSG.kwargs['hello'])

		a, b = Example(), Example()
		a.channel.listen(b.channel)
		a.channel.send(hello='world') # NOTE: emit won't do anything unless running a mainloop...
			# >> in b.channel: "hello world"
		a.channel.ignore(b.channel)
		"""

		- NOTE: the docstrings aren't really used yet, but even in the final version it will be possible to force a
			connection even if there is no docstring, or the docstring suggests incompatibility, it will be up to the
			user there will just be a warning


	SnapMessage: a way of standardizing communication structures, following the "*args, **kwargs" concept in python
		where unused params are just quietly ignored, ensures that all communicable interfaces share the same "call signature"
		(they just accept a single MSG argument)

		MSG.args: positional arguments (tuple)
		MSG.kwargs: keyword arguments (dict)
		MSG.source: the SnapNode instance that did the send/emit creating the message
		MSG.channel: the channel (str) that originated the message

		-- messages should be treated as immutable; don't change them

	snap_debug.py:

		- ENV.snap_out, ENV.snap_warning, ENV.snap_error, ... etc.  give the line number and module path (so you don't have
			to try to find out 'where did I put that print statement?' -- and they could be replaced with redirects to be silent,
			or log output, etc...

	TODO:
		- once the SnapNode protocol was built I just started using it, since I knew the api wouldn't
		change much...  but that means the decorator / bound api could still use more work!
		Specifically: reduce the number of calls (if possible), and make things a bit more sleek under
		the hood so it performs better

		- Better debug info too...  we get like 5 stack traces before the one we're interested in!

		- the primitives api will likely just be phased out, it was from an earlier design and only the
		SnapBytes with the numpy backend is currently useful...  using the python syntax as input means
		python primitives will be available when compiled (as long as the c backend api provides them)

			-- the original idea was to make properties the raw primitives themselves (like listen to an
			int directly for changes) but then I realized that properties are actually attributes of a
			parent type, and don't exist on their own!  So this idea is no longer in play.
				-- to phrase another way: a property change is an event of the parent SnapNode, not of the
				property (data) itself because the property (data) doesn't (necessarily) exist!

					aka. if I have an int property that is created on get() (not locally assigned) then how do
					I listen to the int?  I can't.  It's a new one each time you access it!  But I can listen
					to the property for it's get() events (and that property belongs to the parent SnapNode).

../snap/SnapEnv.py:

	- ENV is a concept I came up with to remove the need of modules to know anything about the context
		in which they are running.  Module 'imports' (getattr(ENV, 'x')) can be changed in ENV before calling
		the module, making it possible to redirect things, and presents interesting opportunities for
		adapters...  I'm thinking it could be useful for legacy code (imagine being able to use the latest
		hd vr keyboard on an old game that was designed to use a regular keyboard, by just writing an adapter
		and assigning the adapter as the ENV keyboard...)

	- Also, it makes the global namespace more dynamic and allows changing variables at runtime, which are then
		visible everywhere

	- applications can import snap.SnapEnv and subclass it to define their own standard ENV, and register themselves
		as an importable package using "SnapEnv.__register_package__("/root/of/package")" which will then allow imports
		subordinate to that package using "SnapEnv.__build__("package.x")"

	- modules compatible with the ENV system implement a "def build(ENV):" and optionally a "def main(ENV):" if they
		want to run directly, and then add their elements into the ENV as one shared namespace

	- the idea is also that ENV can represent a sandbox or isolation of a runnable program, and could be discarded when finished
		so that only necessary components are loaded when they are needed (TODO...)

	- general practice is to put the ENV.__build__ commands into __init__.py files, so we can just import packages by building
		the folder containing the __init__.py file...

	- ENV.__build__('path.to.module') calls the "def build(ENV)" function in the module


../snap/lib/graphics:

	- SnapMatrix -> SnapMetrics -> SnapContainer -> user is the basic intended design, use SnapContainer (or subclass) as the base
		for all of your	renderable elements

	- SnapMatrix: is the base class so that transformables can inherit from it (while also implementing an actual 'matrix'
		property for the low-level matrix data)

		- matrix format is always 3D, to make things simpler -- optimizations may be considered later

	- SnapMetrics: adds the concept of an 'extents' which is a min/max point (x,y,z) of a bounding rect.
		 extents cannot rotate (rotate the matrix) or be negative (max >= min must always be true)

	- paint: color elements (color, gradient, texture, ...)

	- shape: shape elements (path or mesh; connected points)

	- draw() method can be implemented directly on the container for hard-coded render instructions
		or a shader can be assigned, making render logic changeable at runtime (change the theme to another one...)

	- lookup() method is a single pixel render used to find what is "under the mouse" while respecting clipping masks
		and other render configuration, and making it possible to consider things like pixel opacity

		- this is used by the gui for interactions

	- SnapContext: render interface that presents generalized draw instructions that should be available in just about
		any backend engine.  These are the ones prefixed with "cmd_" meaning "command"

	- Engines: the backend implementations for handling the rendering, they subclass the generic shape/paint types and
		for the most part just handle i/o operations to get the data in and out of the engine...


	TODO:
		- make it possible to remap coordinate systems in ENV (by swapping the matrix with one that will convert
		the coordinates internally by doing a fake parent transform using the parent space)

../snap/lib/gui:

	- SnapContainer.device_event() should return True to accept the event, otherwise it will be propagated to the parent
	(if applicable, depends on event behaviour -- proximity events are always sent to all for example)

	TODO:
		- would like to actually remove the qt backend and do something more direct but cross-platform,
		but have to research this...

		../snap/lib/os/devices/keymap:

			- needs to be figured out.  I think identifying keys by name is preferrable to the mess that codes are!
			But still the names would need to be mapped from the gui lib or os!  Every gui seems to have a completely
			different set of keycodes... help!

../snap/lib/parsing/parseq:

	this is my own parser design.  It's designed to be as easy to use as possible, with very straightforward syntax
	and the ability to parse in layers (makes ignoring irrelevant whitespace easy to do, without having to add it to
	the grammar - just capture what you care about in layer 1, and check for patterns in it in layer 2)

	- backend is complete, frontend needs work, but I haven't needed to work on it in quite awhile.  The plan now is
	to have the languages parse their ast for me, removing the need to even have a parser!  Although I imagine it may
	still come in handy...

	- "parseq" as in "parse sequence" - it can handle sequences of anything
		-- also it's a star wars joke/reference (when Han says "parsec" to mean speed, when it's actually a measure of distance.)
		Parseq is really fast :) (even in python!)
		- parseq is fast because of it's multi-pass approach, when the upper levels fail to match it just
		drops down to level 1 (tokens still completed) rather than all the way back to characters...

../snap/lib/programming:

	this is the core functionality, and the newest module. The objective is to be able to take an existing code project (in any
	*supported* language) and 'pull it in' either by compiling it or interpreting it, into a 'generalized'
	format implemented in ANSI c (-std=c89) which should hopefully be very portable...

		- clear and easy to read and understand code is far more valuable to me than fast but hard to read code...

		- python decoding is largely finished (so take a look:
			"python snap/lib/programming/language/python/SnapPythonLanguageDecoder.py"

			- c/c++ is being worked on using json ast from clang (trying to find a way to get complete AST list...)

		... planning on java next, more to come!

	../programming/include/:

		the implementation of the c backend, largely a work in progress!  will be able to say '#include "snap.h"' to use
		-- modules will be built into header files with a <MODULE_NAME>_MAINBODY(ENV) which represents the 'run' of the
			module (code that runs if you imported the module in python)
		-- compilation would create a main.c with initialization of the ENV, include all modules, and then call MAINBODY(ENV)
			of each imported module

	../programming/include/snap/core/snap_types.h:

		SnapObject_t* defines the basic object type interface, SnapEnv_data_t* will be the __bytes__ of ../programming/include/snap/types/SnapEnv.py

	../programming/SnapInternalCompiler.py:

		working on using this (old) design to compile a usable core while being able to type python to implement :)

		try it out: "python snap/lib/programming/SnapInternalCompiler.py"

	../programming/project/SnapProject.py:

		- this is my main focus right now, once this is complete navigating through code will be much easier...

		- primary api (with gui) to be able to navigate through code to find components you need...  try:
			"python snap/lib/programming/project/SnapProject.py"


	TODO:

		- all of it!

		The idea is to map the concepts presented by the coding language into a more generalized language-neutral
		form (but based largely on the design concepts of python (object orientation, async, ...)), so they can play nicely together, making it very easy to pull parts of a project or the whole thing into an ENV to run and do what you want to do with it...

		- The key insight was that languages usually provide their own ast output, so if we just convert that to json
		with generalized (language-neutral) descriptions then we could support potentially any/all languages by:

			- re-organizing the ast into new structures that perform equivalent behaviour (using existing node types)
			AND/OR:
			- defining new operations (or adding extra behaviour to existing operations) in the compiler (when necessary)

		- op-codes are c functions that perform operations on the current ENV, and stack...
			- by compiling to c, it's easier than going to assembly (with all the hardware versions, c handles the compiling
			to assembly part)
			- c allows for higher-level abstraction and reasoning, and makes it easier to implement more complex datastructures
			for the compiler to make use of (representing classes and functions, and making everything a SnapObject_t* type...)
				-- I have no idea how I would even begin representing object orientation in pure assembly!

		- I've actually only had this concept in mind for a few months now, so lots of TODO!
		Gonna try to get the SnapProgrammingLanguageCompiler.py working by following "Python-3.12.3/Python/compile.c"
		at https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3123/ and referring to this guide:
		https://realpython.com/cpython-source-code-guide/#core-compilation-process

			- python has many custom op codes (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#python-bytecode-instructions)
			so the idea of creating custom op-codes to support features from other languages doesn't seem so far-fetched...

			- most languages have common concepts (classes/types, functions, ints, floats, ...) so generalizing to a common
				form for atleast those should be easy enough...

			- wish me luck! (and thanks for any help!)



if you've read all this, I thank you very much for doing so!  I appreciate your interest, and look forward to your feedback and input!  Cheers!
